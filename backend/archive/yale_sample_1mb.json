I’ve been featured on radio broadcasts including A Prairie Home Companion, where I had the amazing opportunity to work with the incredible violinist Hilary Hahn; my performance of Clara Schumann’s Variations in a Theme by Robert was recently featured on NPR’s Performance Today; and I’ve been featured in collaborative performances on both PBS and WQXR. \n\nI’m currently touring the U.S., Canada, and Europe with my solo recital project, “Stories Without Words”, featuring music that tells a story.

This helped me to work very well with all my colleagues in the different departments of the companies.\n\nRegardless of the future job, I am recommended by empathy, curiosity and adaptability to different situations and people. My main goal is for the people I interact with to leave a smile on their face.","activity":null,"avatar":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2","banner_image":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E16AQEveV2tZ-0kgg/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_200_800/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_200_800/0/1615055895613?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Yo-0Cf5iCxtll0IIpgzEHh8szFPaddsdlL6mPNi9qus","bio_links":null,"certifications":null,"city":"Rome, Latium, Italy","connections":500,"country_code":"IT","courses":[{"subtitle":"-","title":"Business Mastery"}],"current_company":{"company_id":"hotel-ta-cenc-spa","link":"https://mt.linkedin.com/company/hotel-ta-cenc-spa?trk=public_profile_topcard-current-company","name":"Hotel Ta Cenc & Spa","title":"Guest Experience Specialist   Front Office Manager\n\n(with a particular knack in Online Brand Reputation management)"},"current_company_company_id":"hotel-ta-cenc-spa","current_company_name":"Hotel Ta Cenc & Spa","default_avatar":true,"education":[{"degree":"LWT","description":"Online Program, with Robin Sharma, one of the Top 5 global experts in Leadership and Business Mastery, advisor to Ceos / boards profiles and Fortune 500 Companies which include many of the best companies on the planet such as Microsoft, GE, FedEx, IBM, Nike, NASA, Starbucks, The Coca-Cola Company, Ritz-Carlton Hotels, Panasonic, Dorchester Collection, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Yale University. www.robinsharma.com","description_html":"Online Program, with Robin Sharma, one of the Top 5 global experts in Leadership and Business Mastery, advisor to Ceos / boards profiles and Fortune 500 Companies which include many of the best companies on the planet such as Microsoft, GE, FedEx, IBM, Nike, NASA, Starbucks, The Coca-Cola Company, Ritz-Carlton Hotels, Panasonic, Dorchester Collection, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Yale University.<br>www.robinsharma.com <!---->","field":"Program in Leadership and Business Mastery","institute_logo_url":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/6qpnald1ddva78jx4bnnl3vw","title":"The Master Series Elite Performance Coaching"},{"degree":"TOEFL First Certificate, Proficiency","description":"24445 Northwestern Highway, Suite 209, Southfield, MI 48075 USA","description_html":"24445 Northwestern Highway, Suite 209, Southfield, MI 48075 USA <!---->","end_year":"2014","institute_logo_url":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/6qpnald1ddva78jx4bnnl3vw","start_year":"2013","title":"Language Center International - Southfield, MI 48075 USA"}],"educations_details":"The Master Series Elite Performance Coaching","experience":[{"company":"Hotel Ta Cenc & Spa","company_id":"hotel-ta-cenc-spa","company_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQG4QCKve6uT0w/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1660457001577?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=rqAp-MXcoBjgNvWOWtM_6DVH9ocFu0Ey1dH_4_RQO5s","description_html":null,"end_date":"Jun 2023","location":"Victoria, Malta","start_date":"Oct 2022","title":"Front Office Manager","url":"https://mt.linkedin.com/company/hotel-ta-cenc-spa"},{"company":"Room Mate Hotels","company_id":"room-mate","company_logo_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQFYL-F4Rzg1PQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1713201123800?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Zk36Bk8uJMDyTbw2sRPX6bGuYCYaPzUxyRbiYvMA5F4","description_html":null,"end_date":"Sep 2022","location":"Milan, Lombardy, Italy","start_date":"Jun 2022","title":"Guest Experience Specialist","url":"https://es.linkedin.com/company/room-mate"},{"company":"Hotel Centro Cavour","company_logo_url":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/cs8pjfgyw96g44ln9r7tct85f","description":"•Provide upscale guest service experiences for clients throughout their stay•Promote all hotel amenities, conveniences and programs offered•Promptly address guests’ requests and actively listen to resolve complaints•Answer online reviews on TripAdvisor / Booking / Expedia / Google / Facebook (ghost writer mode)•Analyse customer feedback from hotel and online reviews and suggest ways to improve ratings•Coordinate and manage communication between guests and staff and follow up to ensure we resolve customer concerns","description_html":"&#x2022;Provide upscale guest service experiences for clients throughout their stay<br>&#x2022;Promote all hotel amenities, conveniences and programs offered<br>&#x2022;Promptly address guests&#x2019;

a self-starter and generalist with high-level experience in content strategy, community cultivation, and campaigns that blend branding, engagement, and positive ROI. I've been both an influencer and influencer manager, and understand how to make these partnerships successful. \n\nI've played key roles at early-stage startups, doing everything from art direction to events to acquisition. I've also carved out a career as a multimedia food storyteller. I'm the co-winner of FOOD NETWORK STAR Season 14 and the author of FOOD WHORE: A NOVEL OF DINING & DECEIT, published by William Morrow/ HarperCollins. My food writing has been featured in the New York Times, Eater, Buzzfeed, Entertainment Weekly, Popsugar, and I've cooked on Good Morning America, TODAY, and at major food festivals.\n\nI excel at jack-of-all-trade jobs that require big thinking, creative finesse … and the skills to pull it off. Clients and employers can always rely on me to execute from start to finish, on time, and with excellent communication.","activity":[{"id":"7328386655822753792","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGRuTgEjWlDSg/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZbOo0QoHwAg-/0/1747223531247?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=oifgyvNu4iEdGAWiuINcjsF0fFiAjE1EWDvo7aUH-n0","interaction":"Liked by Jessica Tom","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mikelcirkus_innovate100-innovation-innovatenewjersey-activity-7328386655822753792-nnYR","title":"It's such an honor to be recognized on this list and to be among such an incredible group of NJ Innovators!

His 'bring it on' attitude was infectious for the team, and I never saw him back away from a task, no matter how complex or mundane.

Greg is not afraid to share his ideas, but he is always on board with whatever decision is ultimately made. I was very sorry sorry to see him move on from our group.

Michelow- Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic is a rapidly evolving global emergency that continues to strain healthcare systems. Emerging research describes a plethora of patient factors—including demographic, clinical, immunologic, hematological, biochemical, and radiographic findings—that may be of utility to clinicians to predict COVID‐19 severity and mortality. We present a synthesis of the current literature pertaining to factors predictive of COVID‐19 clinical course and outcomes. Findings associated with increased disease severity and/or mortality include age > 55 years, multiple pre‐existing comorbidities, hypoxia, specific computed tomography findings indicative of extensive lung involvement, diverse laboratory test abnormalities, and biomarkers of end‐organ dysfunction. Hypothesis‐driven research is critical to identify the key evidence‐based prognostic factors that will inform the design of intervention studies to improve the outcomes of patients with COVID‐19 and to appropriately allocate scarce resources.","subtitle":"Reviews in Medical Virology","title":"Predictors of COVID-19 severity: A literature review"},{"date":"May 2020","description":"- Authors, In Order: Ghazal Aghagoli, BS; Emily Siff, MS; Anastasia C.

S, de Miguel FJ, Perry C, Guan T, Krystal G, Lockwood W, Zelterman D, Homer R, Liu Z, Kaech S, Politi K.BackgroundEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like erlotinib are effective for treating patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer; however, drug resistance inevitably emerges. Approaches to combine immunotherapies and targeted therapies to overcome or delay drug resistance have been hindered by limited knowledge of the effect of erlotinib on tumor-infiltrating immune cells.MethodsUsing mouse models, we studied the immunological profile of mutant EGFR-driven lung tumors before and after erlotinib treatment.ResultsWe found that erlotinib triggered the recruitment of inflammatory T cells into the lungs and increased maturation of alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, this phenotype could be recapitulated by tumor regression mediated by deprivation of the EGFR oncogene indicating that tumor regression alone was sufficient for these immunostimulatory effects. We also found that further efforts to boost the function and abundance of inflammatory cells, by combining erlotinib treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or a CD40 agonist, did not improve survival in an EGFR-driven mouse model.ConclusionsOur findings lay the foundation for understanding the effects of TKIs on the tumor microenvironment and highlight the importance of investigating targeted and immuno-therapy combination strategies to treat EGFR mutant lung cancer.","subtitle":"Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer","title":"Tumor regression mediated by oncogene withdrawal or erlotinib stimulates infiltration of inflammatory immune cells in EGFR mutant lung tumors."},{"date":"September 4, 2015","description":"Valentina Pirazzoli, Deborah Ayeni, Catherine B. Meador, Basavaraju G. Sanganahalli, Fahmeed Hyder, Elisa de Stanchina, Sarah Goldberg, William Pao, Katerina Politi PURPOSE:The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib and afatinib, have transformed the treatment of advanced EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma. However, almost all patients who respond develop acquired resistance on average ~1 year after starting therapy. Resistance is commonly due to a secondary mutation in EGFR (EGFRT790M). We previously found that the combination of the EGFR TKI afatinib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab could overcome EGFRT790M-mediated resistance in preclinical models. This combination has shown a 29% response rate in a clinical trial in patients with acquired resistance to first-generation TKIs. An outstanding question is whether this regimen is beneficial when used as front-line therapy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:Using mouse models of EGFR mutant lung cancer, we tested whether the combination of afatinib plus cetuximab delivered upfront to mice with TKI-naïve EGFRL858R-induced lung adenocarcinomas delayed tumor relapse and drug-resistance compared to single agent TKI.RESULTS:Afatinib plus cetuximab markedly delayed the time to relapse and incidence of drug-resistant tumors, which occurred in only 63% of the mice, in contrast to erlotinib or afatinib treatment where 100% of mice developed resistance. Mechanisms of tumor escape observed in afatinib plus cetuximab resistant tumors include the EGFRT790M mutation and Kras mutations. Experiments in cell lines and xenografts confirmed that the afatinib plus cetuximab combination does not suppress the emergence of EGFRT790M.CONCLUSIONS:These results highlight the potential of afatinib plus cetuximab as an effective treatment strategy for patients with TKI-naïve EGFR mutant lung cancer and indicate that clinical trial development in this area is warranted.","subtitle":"Clinical Cancer Research","title":"Afatinib plus cetuximab delays resistance compared to single agent erlotinib or afatinib in mouse models of TKI-naïve EGFR L858R-induced lung adenocarcinoma"},{"date":"July 13, 2015","description":"Deborah Ayeni, Katerina Politi and Sarah GoldbergThird-generation mutant-specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are showing robustclinical activity, particularly in lung cancers harboring the EGFRT790M mutation, yetacquired resistance to these agents emerges.

Among the various conditions tested, the best yields were obtained with 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl sulfone, in CsF-mediated, room temperature olefinations in DMSO. Aromatic aldehydes gave (trifluoromethyl)vinyl derivatives in 23-86% yields, with generally moderate stereoselectivity. Straightforward synthesis of the Julia-Kocienski reagent, and conversion to trifluoromethyl-substituted alkenes under mild reaction conditions, are the advantages of this approach.","subtitle":"Tetrahedron Letters","title":"Julia-Kocienski Approach to Trifluoromethyl-Substituted Alkenes"}],"recommendations":null,"recommendations_count":null,"similar_profiles":[{"name":"Diane McDermott","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianemcdermott","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianemcdermott"},{"name":"Katharine Foley","title":"Assistant Director of Communications, mom of 2, triathlete, runner, chocolate aficionado","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharine-foley-714a5534","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharine-foley-714a5534"},{"name":"Kelsey Kearns","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-kearns-a8065576","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-kearns-a8065576"},{"name":"Scott Mai","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mai-89939838","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mai-89939838"},{"name":"Lyndsey Wydra","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndseywydra","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndseywydra"},{"name":"Tayler Connolly","title":"Account Director","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylerconnolly32266","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylerconnolly32266"},{"name":"Emily Akada Waite, MA, MSc.","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyakadawaite","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyakadawaite"},{"name":"Mariano Pintor","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianopintor","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianopintor"},{"name":"Daniel John Brennan","title":"Account Director | Saatchi & Saatchi","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljohnbrennan","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljohnbrennan"},{"name":"Nicole Houchin","title":null,"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-houchin-381b7750","url_text":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-houchin-381b7750"}],"url":"https://linkedin.com/in/deborahopeyayeni","volunteer_experience":null},{"about":"Justin Ankney joined Mayhugh Commercial Advisors in 2020 as a sales associate.
