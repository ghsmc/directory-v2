    "Michael Bemis, MLIS \u201cCarissa is a wonderful instructor. She makes learning fun by employing a great variety of teaching methods, such as short videos, small group work, short but information packed lectures, and so on. She encourages student participation with supportive feedback and constructive criticism. I found Carissa to be extremely knowledgeable about her subject matter, fair minded in assigning grades and overall a very engaging personality. It was a pleasure taking her class in ethics at St. Paul College during spring semester of 2013.\u201d"
